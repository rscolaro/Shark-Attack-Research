#**1. Overview**

##**1.1 Introduction**
This analysis is to continue the research on the presence of sharks during the tourist seasons in middle Atlantic and south eastern coastal waters using data mining following the Cross Industry Standard Process for data mining(CRISP-DM). Our study will focus on the analysis of existing data from the International Shark Attack database, weather data from NOAA and calculated moon phase dates. Based on the understanding, a model will be built to uncover various interesting facts about the impact of environmental factors such as moon phases, wind speed and wind direction on creating the favorable conditions for the sharks near the shore. The results of the study could be used to predict the likelihood of Sharks near the shore which could be used as the basis for an application or dashboard which would serve as a warning system near coastal waters with higher plausibility of human activity such as swimming, fishing etc. The Shark Protection Organizations can also make use of such a warning system to take necessary preventive measures for protecting sharks from being slaughtered by humans and thereby saving them from possible extinction.

<br>

##**1.2 Domain Understanding**
It is possible to lessen the likelihood of shark incidents by understanding shark attacks. Humans need to recognize and avoid potentially dangerous situations in the water. The individual case histories provide insights about specific geographical areas and their indigenous species of sharks. However, when all known case histories worldwide are examined, much is revealed about species behavior, and specific patterns emerge. 
Some accidents are motivated by a displacement or territorial behavior when a shark feels threatened; still others are the result of the shark responding to sensory predatory input (i.e., overwhelmed by the presence of many fishes) and environmental conditions (murky water), which may cause them to respond in a reflexive response to stimuli. 

<br>
**1.2.1 Moon Phases**
When the moon and sun align, known as full or new moon, the pull is at its strongest, causing the tides to be at their highest and lowest. This is known as spring tides. The change from high tides to low tides and back again happens very quickly which may cause sharks to move in areas closer to where people swim when the tide is low. The effect on tides occurs over a span of days leading up to the change in the lunar cycle. The effect duration, therefore, is not on the day that is typically depicted as the new or full moon, but can span several days before and after favors shark attacks. 

<br>
**1.2.2 Weather Data**
How shark deals with the extreme weather. As the temperature of the water in-creases, the sharks tend to move into new locations where they will be more comfortable. This means they can be in areas where people are fishing, boating, and swimming.

#**2. Data Understanding**

##**2.1 Data Collection**
 
**Shark Data : ** The principal data source for the incident of shark attack in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Georgia was taken from the incident log of the Shark research Institute defined as the "Global Shark Attack File" (GSAF). The project constrained the study of incidences of shark attacks to be limited from 2016 to 2017 for the months of May to September and from months of May to July for 2018. Since the data of attack were very less during these years, inorder to balance the data more attack cases were added from 2009-2016 to the dataset. 
<br>
**Moon phases:** Moon phases data for the selected month is collected by using lunar library of R.

```{r}
#library(lunar)
#shark.data$moonphase <- lunar.phase(as.Date(shark.data$Date),name=8) 
```

Following values are achieved by running the code:
Waxing Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous, Full moon, Waning Gibbous, Third Quarter, and finally Waxing Crescent. 

**Weather Data :**
Wind speed, Daily Average wind direction, Daily precipitation, Daily Average dew point temperature, Daily Average temp are collected from Weather Underground Datasource.

<br>
<br>

#**3. Strategy**

##**3.1 Methods**
The methodology adopted for the project was the usage of CRISP-DM model.<br>
The data is collected from different sources and merged with global shark attack file primarily by date. The global shark attack files shows only the dates when attack happened, so in order to better train the model about the presence or the absence of the shark near sea shore, more dates in the dataset are populated and the moon phase and weather conditions of specific region i.e. buxton is recorded so as to gain knowledge based on documented attacks.
If the attack did not happen then the corresponding columns are filled with NA values.

<br>

#**4. Exploratory Data Analysis**

```{r,echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
library(DataExplorer)
library(mice)
library(VIM)
```
##**4.1 Summary of Dataset**

```{r}

shark.data <- read.csv(file="SharkAttackData31stJuly2018_V4.csv", header=T, na.strings = c("NA",""," "), stringsAsFactors = F)
attach(shark.data)
#library(lunar)
str(shark.data)
shark.data <- shark.data[,-c(5,7,8,11,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,21,22)]

#shark.data$moonphase <- lunar.phase(as.Date(shark.data$Date),name=8)
summary(shark.data)


```

<br>

##**4.2 Missing Data**
The missing data observed for the dataset is as follows:
```{r}
plot_missing(shark.data)
```
<br>

##**4.3 Location**
It can be seen from the below graph that the most vulnerable county for Shark Attack is **Horry and Charleston** among the locations of South and North Carolina.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="Charleston",x=shark.data$Location) ] <- "Charleston"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="Carteret",x=shark.data$Location) ] <- "Carteret"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern= "Horry",x=shark.data$Location)] <- "Horry"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="Beaufort",x=shark.data$Location)  ] <- "Beaufort"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="Georgetown",x=shark.data$Location) ] <- "Georgetown"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="Brunswick",x=shark.data$Location) ] <- "Brunswick"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="Currituck",x=shark.data$Location) ] <- "Currituck"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="Hyde",x=shark.data$Location) ] <- "Hyde"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="Dare",x=shark.data$Location) ] <- "Dare"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="Pender",x=shark.data$Location) ] <- "Pender"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="New Hanover",x=shark.data$Location) ] <- "New Hanover"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="Onslow",x=shark.data$Location) ] <- "Onslow"
shark.data$County[grepl(pattern="Colleton",x=shark.data$Location) ] <- "Colleton"

library(ggplot2)

sharkAtackLoc <- shark.data$County[shark.data$Attack== "Yes"]
sharkAtackLoc
# counts
ggplot(data.frame(sharkAtackLoc), aes(x=sharkAtackLoc)) +
  geom_bar()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

<br>

##**4.4 Wind Direction**
The given data showed that maximum number of Shark attack occured when the wind was flowing in **SSW and SW**.
<br>**When Attack Occurred**
```{r}
windDirection <- shark.data$Wd.Direction[shark.data$Attack== "Yes"]
windDirection
# counts
ggplot(data.frame(windDirection), aes(x=windDirection)) +
  geom_bar()+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + ggtitle("Wind Direction for Attack='Y'")

```
**Overlayed Bar Chart for Wind Direction and Attack**
```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_bar(data = shark.data,
           aes(x = factor(shark.data$Wd.Direction),
               fill = factor(shark.data$Attack)),
           position = "stack") +
  scale_x_discrete("Wind Direction") +
  scale_y_continuous("Count") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Attack")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("blue", "red")) + ggtitle("Overlayed bar graph for Wind Direction")
```


<br>

##**4.5 Exploring DailyAverageTemperature, DailyAverageDewPotTemp, DailyAverageWdSpeed, and DailyPrecipitation**
For inital data exploration we used the same process on these four variables. First we plot a histogram for all the data of each variable to check its general shape. Since the variables are all numeric our next step is to bin them into 'Low', 'Medium', and 'High' catagories using equal width binning. <i>Refer to section 5.3 for binning</i>
<br>

##**4.6 Moon Phases**
Maximum shark attacks happened in New Moon phase.
During the waxing gibbous and waning crescent phases, the Moon is approaching its full and new phases, respectively. 
Because of this, the resulting tidal bulges will increase in size until they reach their maximum during the spring tides.
```{r}

##### selecting the records in which attack has happened for EDA
shark.data_attack <- subset(shark.data, shark.data$Attack=="Yes")
plot_bar(shark.data_attack$moonphase)

```

<br>

##**4.7 Density Graph for the Shark Attack Data**
```{r}
plot_density(shark.data)
```

<br>


##**4.8 Understanding the Correlation**

Checking for the correlation between the attributes.

```{r}
plot(shark.data$DailyPrecipitation, shark.data$DailyAverageTemperature)
plot(shark.data$DailyAverageDewPotTemp, shark.data$DailyPrecipitation)
plot(shark.data$DailyAverageDewPotTemp, shark.data$DailyAverageTemperature)
```

DailyAverageTemperature and DailyAverageDewPotTemp are probably related as the average temperature should influence the dew temperature it makes sense to check for a correlation between the two.
```{r}
plot_correlation(shark.data[,c("DailyAverageTemperature", "DailyAverageDewPotTemp")], use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

```
The plot indicates that the two variables are indeed correlated strongly so it is likely that one of them may be left out during modeling.

<br><br>

#**5. Data Preparation**
The data for Shark Attack has been colleced for three years during the tourist period from various sources and have been integrated. Raw data was noisy and unfit to run models on them.  Country column was a unary attribute with value USA for all the records and can be easily removed. Therefore, following data preparation steps were taken for data cleaning:
<br>


##**5.1 Handling Outliers**
Our first setep was to check for missing values in the four columns.

```{r}
sapply(shark.data[,c("DailyAverageTemperature", "DailyAverageDewPotTemp", "DailyAverageWdSpeed", "DailyPrecipitation")], function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

```

We can see that there are some missing values in each column. We were unable to find weather data for a little over a period of a little over a month. That means these rows need to removed for most of our modeling as we are mainly analyzing weather data so they contribute nothing.


After removing the rows with missing data we check each variable for outliers using the zscore method.

**DailyAverageTemperature**

```{r}
shark.data.removedNAs <- shark.data[!is.na(shark.data$DailyAverageTemperature),]
shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageTemperature <- (shark.data.removedNAs$DailyAverageTemperature - mean(shark.data.removedNAs$DailyAverageTemperature))/sd(shark.data.removedNAs$DailyAverageTemperature)
cat("Number of lower range outliers: ", length(shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageTemperature[shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageTemperature < -3]))
cat("Number of upper range outliers: ", length(shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageTemperature[shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageTemperature > 3]))

```

**DailyAverageDewPotTemp**

```{r}
shark.data.removedNAs<- shark.data[!is.na(shark.data$DailyAverageDewPotTemp),]
shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageDewPotTemp <- (shark.data.removedNAs$DailyAverageDewPotTemp - mean(shark.data.removedNAs$DailyAverageDewPotTemp))/sd(shark.data.removedNAs$DailyAverageDewPotTemp)
cat("Number of lower range outliers: ", length(shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageDewPotTemp[shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageDewPotTemp < -3]))
cat("Number of upper range outliers: ", length(shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageDewPotTemp[shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageDewPotTemp > 3]))

```

**DailyAverageWdSpeed**

```{r}

shark.data.removedNAs<- shark.data[!is.na(shark.data$DailyAverageWdSpeed),]
shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageWdSpeed <- (shark.data.removedNAs$DailyAverageWdSpeed - mean(shark.data.removedNAs$DailyAverageWdSpeed))/sd(shark.data.removedNAs$DailyAverageWdSpeed)
cat("Number of lower range outliers: ", length(shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageWdSpeed[shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageWdSpeed < -3]))
cat("Number of upper range outliers: ", length(shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageWdSpeed[shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyAverageWdSpeed > 3]))

```

**DailyPrecipitation**

```{r}
shark.data.removedNAs<- shark.data[!is.na(shark.data$DailyPrecipitation),]
shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyPrecipitation <- (shark.data.removedNAs$DailyPrecipitation - mean(shark.data.removedNAs$DailyPrecipitation))/sd(shark.data.removedNAs$DailyPrecipitation)
cat("Number of lower range outliers: ", length(shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyPrecipitation[shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyPrecipitation < -3]))
cat("Number of upper range outliers: ", length(shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyPrecipitation[shark.data.removedNAs$zscore.DailyPrecipitation > 3]))

```

All four columns have very few outliers so we decided to check the actual max and min values in each column.

```{r}
summary(shark.data.removedNAs[,c("DailyAverageTemperature", "DailyAverageDewPotTemp", "DailyAverageWdSpeed", "DailyPrecipitation")])

```

None of the max or min values are out of the ordinary for weather patterns so it is very likely they are correct. For this reason we decided to leave the outliers alone for now, altough we may remove them at a later stage if needed.

<br>

##**5.2 Missing Data Handling**
Data had some missing values which was a hinderance for normalization of the data. In order to make data fit for modelling these missing data was replaced by **Imputed Values** using Mice.
<br>


```{r}
#Store the Numeric Columns with Missing Values in temporary dataset
str(shark.data)
shark.data.temp <- shark.data[,-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,15,16,17,18,19)] 
# added column 2(date) which will be used to merge imputed data with original data
sapply(shark.data.temp, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

#Run Mice to impute the data
md.pattern(shark.data.temp)
```
**Mice Plot for Missing Data**
```{r}
mice_plot <- aggr(shark.data.temp, col=c('navyblue','yellow'),
numbers=TRUE, sortVars=TRUE,
labels=names(shark.data.temp), cex.axis=.7,
gap=3, ylab=c("Proportion of Missingness","Missingness Pattern"))
```
```{r,include=FALSE}
imputed_Data <- mice(shark.data.temp, m=5, maxit = 40, method = 'pmm', seed = 500)
imputed_Data
```
```{r}
#Store the data with imputed values in complete_data
complete_data=complete(imputed_Data,5)
md.pattern(complete_data)
sapply(complete_data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

#Add Column for imputed values the imputed values with the current dataset
shark.data$DailyAverageDewPotTemp_imputed <- complete_data$DailyAverageDewPotTemp
shark.data$DailyPrecipitation_imputed <- complete_data$DailyPrecipitation
```

<br>

<br>

##**5.3 Binning the data** 
Numeric data present in the dataset such as DailyAverageTemperature, DailyAverageDewPotTemp, DailyAverageWdSpeed, and DailyPrecipitation has been bined into three levels: low, medium and high. 
We decided to bin these variables for readbility in the next step as well as if we decide to use a model that requires binning later on. Next we create a bar plot of the binned data for all values as well as a bar plot for only the days when a shark attack occurred.

**5.3.1 DailyAverageTemperature**
```{r}
plot_histogram(shark.data$DailyAverageTemperature, title ="Histogram for Daily Avg. Temp. after imputation")
shark.data.temperature <- kmeans(shark.data$DailyAverageTemperature , centers = 3)
shark.data.temperature $centers
whichbin <- shark.data.temperature$cluster
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageTemperature <- whichbin
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageTemperature[shark.data$binned.DailyAverageTemperature == 1] <- "Low"
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageTemperature[shark.data$binned.DailyAverageTemperature == 2] <- "High"
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageTemperature[shark.data$binned.DailyAverageTemperature == 3] <- "Medium"
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
barplot(table(shark.data$binned.DailyAverageTemperature), main="All Rows")
barplot(table(shark.data$binned.DailyAverageTemperature[shark.data$Attack == "Yes"]), main="Attacks Only")


```

**5.3.2 DailyAverageDewPotTemp**
```{r}
plot_histogram(shark.data$DailyAverageDewPotTemp_imputed, title="Histogram for Daily Avg. Dew Point after imputation")
shark.data.dewtemperature <- kmeans(shark.data$DailyAverageDewPotTemp_imputed , centers = 3)
shark.data.dewtemperature $centers
whichbin <- shark.data.dewtemperature$cluster
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageDewPotTemp <- whichbin
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageDewPotTemp[shark.data$binned.DailyAverageDewPotTemp == 1] <- "Low"
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageDewPotTemp[shark.data$binned.DailyAverageDewPotTemp == 2] <- "High"
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageDewPotTemp[ shark.data$binned.DailyAverageDewPotTemp == 3] <- "Medium"
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
barplot(table(shark.data$binned.DailyAverageDewPotTemp), main="All Rows")
barplot(table(shark.data$binned.DailyAverageDewPotTemp[shark.data$Attack == "Yes"]), main="Attacks Only")


```

**5.3.3 DailyAverageWdSpeed**
```{r}
plot_histogram(shark.data$DailyAverageWdSpeed, title="Histogram for Daily Avg. Wind Speed after imputation")
shark.data.windSpeed <- kmeans(shark.data$DailyAverageWdSpeed, centers = 3)
shark.data.windSpeed $centers
whichbin <- shark.data.windSpeed$cluster
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageWdSpeed <- whichbin
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageWdSpeed[shark.data$binned.DailyAverageWdSpeed == 1] <- "Low"
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageWdSpeed[shark.data$binned.DailyAverageWdSpeed == 2] <- "High"
shark.data$binned.DailyAverageWdSpeed[shark.data$binned.DailyAverageWdSpeed == 3] <- "Medium"
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
barplot(table(shark.data$binned.DailyAverageWdSpeed), main="All Rows")
barplot(table(shark.data$binned.DailyAverageWdSpeed[shark.data$Attack == "Yes"]), main="Attacks Only")


```

**5.3.4 DailyPrecipitation**
```{r}
plot_histogram(shark.data$DailyPrecipitation_imputed, title="Histogram for Daily Avg. Precipitation after imputation")
shark.data.precipitation <- kmeans(shark.data$DailyPrecipitation_imputed , centers = 3)
shark.data.precipitation $centers
whichbin <- shark.data.precipitation$cluster
shark.data$binned.DailyPrecipitation <- whichbin
shark.data$binned.DailyPrecipitation[shark.data$binned.DailyPrecipitation == 1] <- "Low"
shark.data$binned.DailyPrecipitation[shark.data$binned.DailyPrecipitation == 2] <- "High"
shark.data$binned.DailyPrecipitation[ shark.data$binned.DailyPrecipitation == 3] <- "Medium"
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
barplot(table(shark.data$binned.DailyPrecipitation), main="All Rows")
barplot(table(shark.data$binned.DailyPrecipitation[shark.data$Attack == "Yes"]), main="Attacks Only")

```

The results initially seem to indicate that shark attacks occour more often during dry, hot weather. Upon closer inspection however we can see that the vast majority of the time there is no rain, so naturally shark attacks are more likely to occour when it is dry but the two are probably not related. For temperature our data comes from the summer months so it is mostly hot, although there is more variance than precipitation. Thus it seems reasonable to assume that shark attacks are more likely in warm or hot weather. Wind speed seem  to be relatively evenly spread and so doesn't provide much information.





<br>

##**5.4 Correlation among the attributes**

Correlation between the attributes has been calculated and it was observed that DailyAverageTemperature and DailyAverageDewPotTemp are strongly correlated so it is likely that one of them may be left out during modeling.<i>Please refer to EDA section</i> 
<br>

##**5.5 Normalization**
Since DailyAverageTemperature, DailyAverageDewPotTemp, DailyAverageWdSpeed, and DailyPrecipitation columns were on different scale making it difficult to compare them.
Therefore, normalization has been carried out in order to bring them into the same scale.

```{r}
means = apply(complete_data,2,mean)
sds = apply(complete_data,2,sd)
shark.data.normalized = scale(complete_data,center=means,scale=sds)
shark.data.normalized <- as.data.frame(shark.data.normalized)

shark.data$DailyPrecipitation_normalized <- shark.data.normalized$DailyPrecipitation
shark.data$DailyAverageDewPotTemp_normalized <- shark.data.normalized$DailyAverageDewPotTemp
shark.data$DailyAverageWdSpeed_normalized <- shark.data.normalized$DailyAverageWdSpeed
shark.data$DailyAverageTemperature_normalized <- shark.data.normalized$DailyAverageTemperature

head(shark.data)
```
<br>

##**5.6 Principal Component Analysis**

As correlation showed Dew point temperature and average daily temperature are strongly related, we applied PCA which also showed the same results. Using domain knowledge we know, temperature will mostly be high during this durationin North and South Carolina. Therefore we can remove that column.
```{r}
d <- shark.data[,c(14,12,16,17)]
pc <- princomp(d, cor= TRUE,score= TRUE)
biplot(pc)
```
<br>

##**5.7 Calculation of Proportion after undersampling**

The number of records with Attack equal to Yes were 77 in total. This was definitely less than the total number of days taken for the years between the months of May to September. Hence when the GSAF file was combined with the file con-taining all dates it led to a data imbalance problem. In order to solve the problem, a stratified sampling of Attack=No subset was prepared so that 1/3 of records remain with adequate representation for each class. To evaluate the efficiency of the solution applied to the data imbalance problem, undersampling of the records with attack="No" was done and the proportions of wind speed, wind direction and moonphase was compared with the original dataset. 


Reading the file which has undersampled data
```{r include= FALSE}

#**6. Data Modelling Plan**
Cross-Validation technique will be applied on the dataset to divide it among training and test dataset. The target variable for Shark Attack is a categorical value. Therefore, different classification algorithms like decision trees and k nearest neighbour will be applied on for training the model. Results for both the models will then be evaluated and the best model will be selected for prediction. Depending on the detail of this analysis, clustering and association rules can be touched along with classification methods.

##**6.1 Data Partitioning**

```{r inlcude= FALSE}
shark.data.modelling$Wd.Direction <- factor(shark.data.modelling$Wd.Direction)
shark.data.modelling$Attack <- factor(shark.data.modelling$Attack)
shark.data.modelling$moonphase <- factor(shark.data.modelling$moonphase)
```

```{r}
library(caret)
train.rows <- createDataPartition(y= shark.data.modelling$Attack, p=0.75, list = FALSE)
train.data <- shark.data.modelling[train.rows,]
table(train.data$Attack)
test.data <- shark.data.modelling[-train.rows,]
table(test.data$Attack)
str(shark.data.modelling)
```

<br>
<br>

#**7. Data Modelling**

##**7.1 Random Forest**

```{r, include=FALSE}
#Import Libraries
if(!require(caret)) install.packages("caret",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
if(!require(randomForest)) install.packages("randomForest",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
if(!require(pROC)) install.packages("pROC",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
if(!require(WVPlots)) install.packages("WVPlots",repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(caret)
library(randomForest)
library(pROC)
library(WVPlots)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
#importing, undersampling, and creating train test split
#remove code as needed
#shark.data <- read.csv(file="shark_attack_final_dataset.csv", header=T, na.strings = c("NA",""," "), stringsAsFactors = F)
#shark.data <- read.csv(file="shark_attack_final_dataset.csv", header=T, na.strings = c("NA",""," "), stringsAsFactors = F)
#shark.data$Wd.Direction <- factor(shark.data$Wd.Direction)
#shark.data$Attack <- factor(shark.data$Attack)
#shark.data$moonphase <- factor(shark.data$moonphase)
#shark.data.small <- shark.data[-sample(which(shark.data$Attack == "No"), 200),]
#table(shark.data.small$Attack)
#train.rows <- createDataPartition(y= shark.data.small$Attack, p=0.7, list = FALSE)
#train.data <- shark.data.small[train.rows,]
#table(train.data$Attack)
#test.data <- shark.data.small[-train.rows,]
#table(test.data$Attack)
#str(shark.data.small)


```

We train a random forest using moonphase, wind speed, and wind direction to predict shark attacks. We chose these values based on domain knowledge as well as the fact that our data is taken from the summer months so temperature and precipitation do no vary enough to contribute to our model. We then examine the model and also check which of the predictors is most important to the classification.

```{r}
rf_classifier = randomForest(Attack ~ Wd.Direction + moonphase + DailyAverageWdSpeed, data=train.data, ntree=100, mtry=2, importance=TRUE)
rf_classifier
varImpPlot(rf_classifier)
```

Then we test our forest by classifying new data. To check our accuracy we look at a confusion matrix, gain curve plot, and AUC.

```{r}
test.data$forest.pred <- predict(rf_classifier, test.data)
confusionMatrix(test.data$Attack, test.data$forest.pred, positive = "Yes")
GainCurvePlot(test.data, "forest.pred", "Attack", "Gain Curve for Random Forest")
test.data$forest.pred.prob <- predict(rf_classifier, test.data, type= "prob")
auc(as.numeric(test.data$Attack), test.data$forest.pred.prob[,1])
```

<br>

##**6.2 Logistic Regression**

Next we train a logistic regression model using the same predictors and examine the fit.

```{r}
glm.fit <- glm(Attack ~ Wd.Direction + moonphase + DailyAverageWdSpeed, data = train.data, family = binomial)
summary(glm.fit)
```

We then classify new data and examine the same three metrics: confustion matrix, gain curve plot, and AUC.

```{r}
test.data$logistic.pred <- predict(glm.fit, newdata = test.data, type = "response")
test.data$logistic.pred <- ifelse(test.data$logistic.pred >= 0.5, "Yes", "No")
test.data$logistic.pred <- factor(test.data$logistic.pred)
confusionMatrix(test.data$Attack, test.data$logistic.pred, positive = "Yes")
GainCurvePlot(test.data, "logistic.pred", "Attack", "Gain Curve for Logistic Regression")
auc(test.data$Attack, as.numeric(test.data$logistic.pred))
```

##**6.3 Association Rules**
The association rules on moonphase, binned wind speed, and wind direction are applied using rattle. We chose these values based on domain knowledge as well as the fact that our data is taken from the summer months so temperature and precipitation do no vary enough to contribute to the association rules.
